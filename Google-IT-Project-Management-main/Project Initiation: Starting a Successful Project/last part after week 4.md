you've learned so far about the ins and outs of successfully kicking off a project. You dug deeper on initiation, the first phase of the project life cycle, and how important
it is to determine your project scope, including what's in-scope and what's not. You also learned about project goals and deliverables, and you learned how to measure project
success by creating success criteria early on.

Then you learned to define project roles and responsibilities. Choosing the right people for a project team is a big decision and one you'll always want to consider carefully.
You now know how to create a stakeholder analysis that tells you how and when to communicate with different stakeholders, and you learned how to create and track team 
accountability using a RACI chart.

You also studied the final steps of the initiation phase: identifying resources, creating documentation, and selecting tools. You learned about the resources that project
managers rely on to achieve the goals of a project, from budgets to people to the materials needed to complete a deliverable. You also learned the value of documenting your 
work using a project charter, which is a key step to getting approval to start your project.

Lastly, you learned about the many types of tools that can help you be a more efficient project managerâ€”from straightforward tools like email, to sophisticated tools like 
Asana. Completing this course is no small feat, and you've put in hours of work.
