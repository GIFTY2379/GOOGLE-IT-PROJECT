Question 1 In this exercise, you will read a scenario and identify the six key components of project initiation: 

Goals
Scope 
Project deliverables 
Success criteria 
Stakeholders
Resources 


Start by reading the scenario: Imagine you are a project manager at an educational software company. Youâ€™re assigned a new project to develop a digital grading platform for
a local high school. Before beginning the project, you meet with teachers, school administrators, the school IT department, and the district superintendent to discuss the
project and get their input. During these meetings, you organized your thoughts by writing down project key components that the stakeholders have requested. 

Your notes on the key components are: $150,000 maximum budget Team: can add one member from the school IT department Platform should allow teachers to enter grades and allow 
students/parents to view grades Need full teacher buy-in at high school: 100% adoption within next nine months Project should focus only on the digital grading platform and 
NOT impact other digital platforms (ex. attendance, school lunch payments) Overall, the school is seeking a platform for digital grading The next step in the project is to 
organize the key components into a project charter. You will then present the charter to the individuals involved with the project. The project charter ensures everyone is 
aligned before planning and then executing the project.
