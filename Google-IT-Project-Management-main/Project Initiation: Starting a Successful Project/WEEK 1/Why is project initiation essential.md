Why is project initiation essential


Because initiation is the first phase of the project, it's really important to get it right. A well-planned initiation results in a strong foundation for your project, and 
sets it up for success.

Initiation begins after a problem or opportunity has been identified within an organization.

Often, stakeholders like senior leaders at a company will initiate a project to address a specific need for the business. For example, perhaps the company would like to roll
out a new product, improve employee well being, or reduce costs in a certain department.

It's your responsibility as the project manager to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project stakeholders.
Even though someone else might come up with an idea for the project, it's still your job to figure out all the important pieces that need to come together in order to get
the work done.

The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders the right questions, performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of
a project. Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project. If this seems a bit overwhelming, don't worry.

We'll talk more about project scope later on in this course. If the project isn't initiated properly, things can go wrong pretty fast. For example, without sufficient 
understanding of the project's goals, you might underestimate what resources you need or how long the project might take. 

Or, without agreeing with stakeholders on what success looks like, you might think the project was completed successfully, while the stakeholders might think it didn't 
accomplish their goals. Getting on the same page and gaining clarity during the initiation phase can save a lot of time and extra work for everyone throughout the project.
Proper initiation also helps ensure that the benefits of the project outcomes will outweigh the costs of the project.

To determine this, you'll do what's called a cost benefit analysis, which is the process of adding up the expected value of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the
dollar costs. To do this, you will work with stakeholders to consider a few questions. To determine the benefits of a project, those questions might include: What value will
this project create? How much money could this project save our organization?

How much money will it bring in from existing customers? How much time will be saved? 

How will the user experience be improved? And to determine the costs of the project, those questions might include: How much time will people have to spend on this project?
What will be the one-time costs?

Are there any ongoing costs? What about long-term costs? The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions
early on. Coming up, we'll talk more about the initiation phase and explore the key components of initiating a project.
