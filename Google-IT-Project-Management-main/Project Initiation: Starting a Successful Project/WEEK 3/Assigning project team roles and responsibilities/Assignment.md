Scenario
Line break
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As the lead project manager for the Plant Pals project, you’re managing the launch of this new service. Previously, you worked with your project team as they developed a
marketing plan, wrote promotional copy, designed marketing assets, and created a sales plan for customer outreach.

Now you are gathering a new team to design and develop the Plant Pals landing page. When potential customers click on Plant Pals advertisements, the landing page is the
first part of the Office Green website they will see. The team members you need to build the landing page include: 

Web Manager: Makes final decisions about new site features and content changes. They sign off on the landing page design and launch plans. They also coordinate maintenance 
and management tasks to keep the page operating smoothly. 

Graphic Designer: Creates and chooses images and typefaces for the landing page and submits them to the Web Designer for approval. They also provide feedback on the 
landing page design and mockup. 

Web Developer: Supports the product team by writing the code that powers the site. They give feedback to the Web Designer on the landing page mockup. The Web Developer also 
helps set quality standards for the project.

Quality Assurance Tester: Reviews system specifications and runs quality tests for the new landing page. They run test scripts and review results, create reports, and 
document technical issues. These tests identify problems that the team can then resolve before launch. 

Content Writer: Creates the written content that explains how Plant Pals works and helps potential customers sign up for the service. They give feedback to the Web Designer
on the landing page mockup.

Web Designer: Creates the landing page design, determining how the page looks and how customers interact with it. The Web Designer connects the creative and technical
elements of the project, ensuring that the website is both attractive and functional. They report to the Web Manager, who makes final decisions on new site features.

To build and launch a landing page for Plant Pals, the team needs to accomplish the following tasks:

Design a landing page 

Create a landing page mockup

Design image assets

Write content

Code the landing page

Test the landing page

Step 2: Add tasks to the RACI chart

Add the six tasks from the scenario to your RACI chart template under the Task/Deliverable heading. Replace “Task/Deliverable” with the name of each task.

Step 3: Assign roles to the RACI chart

Update the Role headers with each team member role from the scenario. Replace “Role A” with “Web Manager,” and so on.

Step 4: Assign letters in the RACI chart

For each task, assign the letters R, A, C, and I to the team members involved. Consult the descriptions below to determine how your team members relate to the tasks:

Responsible: Who is responsible for completing this task? Consider these questions when determining who is responsible:

Which department manages the work?

Who should perform the work?

Accountable: Who is accountable if the task isn’t completed? Remember that only one person should be accountable for each task or deliverable. When deciding who is 
accountable, ask yourself: 

Who might delegate the task to another team member?

Who makes final decisions about the task?

Who should review the work to confirm it is complete?

Consulted: Who should be consulted for their insights, expertise, or strong opinions on the task? Here are a few questions to help identify whether someone should be
consulted:

Who can give feedback to responsible individuals to help them complete tasks? 

Who are the subject matter experts (SMEs) for the task?

Informed: Who should be kept informed about task progress or project decisions? Key questions to ask yourself include: 

Who is invested in task completion but not directly involved in the work? 

Who is affected by the project outcome?

Note: The number of stakeholders you keep informed about each task can vary depending on your situation. In some cases, you might choose to inform all stakeholders who
aren't responsible, accountable, or consulted. In others, you could leave some cells in your RACI chart blank for certain tasks. Both approaches are fine for this activity.

Pro Tip: Save the Template
Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the RACI chart template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or 
professional projects. Templates like this one will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to talk through your 
thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.
