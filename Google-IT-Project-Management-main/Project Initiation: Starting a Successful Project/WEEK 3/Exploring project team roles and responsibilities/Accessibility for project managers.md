Accessibility for project managers


In project management, you, yourself, people on your project team, or people highly invested in your project may have a disability, whether visible or invisible. 

As a project manager, you are responsible for making sure a group of people can come together to achieve a common goal using shared tools and systems. In order to be successful,
you need to make sure the infrastructure and culture you set up works for everyone.

Knowing this is a key element of project management. I'll teach you how to make your work and content accessible. I'll also help you become a better project manager by
considering accessibility in your future projects. I'll offer tips and best practices throughout the program, starting with this one. Did you know that many technologies that
we all enjoy started out as an accessibility feature? Think about the Google Assistant, which allows you to control your home with your voice, or close captioning, which makes
it possible to watch the TV above a crowded, noisy bar.

By considering accessibility, you can impact everyone's lives for the better. I'm excited to share more with you throughout the program where you'll learn more about project 
management and prepare for a career in this field.
