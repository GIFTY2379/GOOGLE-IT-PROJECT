Amar: Tools are our best friends


As a Project Manager, tools are our best friends. Tools and the tools which will help us drive the executionâ€”those should be near and dear to us, and those are near and 
dear to me. What I look at is what tools will help me create the body of work. 

There are a lot of open source tools as free tools, like Google Spreadsheets are there, Google Docs is there. Many of these tools are out there, and there are some other
supporting tools also, like JIRA and ALM. These will help you create the body of work. This will help you define that what needs to be delivered and when. This will help 
you create the timeline. There are timeline tools, like Gantt Chart, Gantt tools, that you will find out.

Then there are tools which will help you drive the visibility across the board and that drive the dependent ecosystem. We want to make sure when we are starting the project, 
we look at the available toolset so that we are not defragging the system that much, we are not really kind of adding too many complexities on new tools in the ecosystems.

We want make sure that, ok, what are the current tools which are out there? Have a look at this toolset. Find out, are those supported? Find out what's the current adoption
rate, and look at what are the gaps. If there are gaps, go for new tools. Propose new tools to improve productivity.

But if there's an existing toolset which our team is following, which your team is following, try to learn those tools because those are the tools which will get quick 
adoption, and those will be an amazing toolset to have with you.
