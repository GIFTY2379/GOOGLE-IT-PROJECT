Utilizing tools for effective project management


As a project manager, tools are some of the most helpful resources you have at your disposal. They're essential for tracking progress, so it's important to keep them top of 
mind throughout the entire project. 

Let's talk more about why tools are so useful and why it's important to choose the right ones for your needs. There are lots of different tools out there, and you'll learn more
about them later. As a reminder, tools are aids that make it easier for a project manager or team to manage resources and organize work. They're useful because they can help
you track detailed information about all kinds of tasks, and they make it easy to communicate with lots of different people. 

And remember, effective communication and tracking are huge parts of a project manager's day-to-day responsibilities. Just think about how much tougher your job would be
without help from collaboration tools like e-mail or digital documents created in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Let's imagine this in the context of our project at Office
Green.

As lead project manager, you have tons of information about the company's plan to provide office-friendly plants to top clients. But what would happen if you wrote every project 
detail on a whiteboard instead of a shared online document? Well, every member of your team would have to stop by your desk to get the latest information, and that's definitely
not the most efficient use of anyone's time.

But if you store this information in easily-accessible online documents, you save everyone on the team time, energy, and a major headache. Today's tools have made it so much
easier to share information with teammates. Even better with project management tools, information sharing goes both ways. That means team members can also easily update you on
their progress without the need for extra meetings or phone calls. How great is that? When you choose the right tool for a project, you make it easy for teammates to let you
know if a task is on schedule or if it's delayed, which lets you quickly see how any changes might affect the rest of the project.

Project management tools increase visibility and transparency for everyone, including stakeholders. You can use a variety of tools to accomplish many different things, like
tracking progress on tasks, deliverables, and milestones. Tools can also help you manage a budget, build helpful charts and diagrams, manage contracts and licenses, and keep
stakeholders informed. 

Tools can be straightforward, like digital spreadsheets or documents, or they can be more sophisticated, like scheduling and work management software. It's important to think
about the needs of the project when choosing which to use.

One thing to keep in mind is that if you choose a more sophisticated tool, your teammates and stakeholders will need some time to get familiar with it. For small projects, that
might be more trouble than it's worth. So for small projects, a straightforward tool might be more effective. 

But if a project has a big scope, then it might be worth the team's time to learn and ultimately work with a more sophisticated project management tool. You should also keep 
in mind that sometimes you won't have a choice about the types of tools you use.

If an organization has already decided to use a specific tool, then you will need to work with what they give you. It's all about remaining flexible. Are you starting to see
how you can use tools to keep projects on track? Whether they're straightforward or sophisticated, tools have the power to help you communicate and manage more 
effectively.
