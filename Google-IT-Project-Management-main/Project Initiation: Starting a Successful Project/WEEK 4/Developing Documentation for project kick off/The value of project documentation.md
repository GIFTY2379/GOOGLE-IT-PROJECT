The value of project documentation

By now, you've probably noticed that a big part of project management is guiding decision-making. Even if you're not the one making final decisions on major aspects of the
project, it's still your job to keep track of every new decision and use those decisions to create a plan. 

As you've learned, there are a lot of important decisions to keep track of. That includes everything from identifying project goals and deliverables to choosing the right people
to add to a team. It's way too much for any one person to mentally keep track of.

It's also important information for everyone on the team to be aware of; not just the project manager. If a decision affects a member of the team's tasks, they'll need to know 
about it, right? That's why documentation is such an important part of a project manager's role. 

While your team may work deeply on specific areas of the project, you might be the only person on the team who is aware of and communicating across all the different areas of
the project. Clear and consistent documentation can ensure transparency and clear communication.

Documentation helps set the stage for the project. It communicates the answers to key questions. For example, what problem are you trying to solve? What are the project goals?
What are the scope and deliverables, and who are the project's stakeholders?

Lastly, what resources does the team need to complete their work? This is all crucial information for anyone who's working on a project, regardless of their role. Documentation
also helps preserve decisions made early on in the project and can serve as a reference point for team members who might join later in the project life cycle.

It's your job to ensure that this information is easily accessible through some kind of formal documentation, like an e-mail, a presentation, or a digital document. Also, 
documenting decisions can help you uncover tasks, timelines, or costs you hadn't previously considered.

And lastly, this process provides a historical record that can be reviewed at the end of your project. You can apply the lessons you've learned in the future. Ok, let's get
into different types of documentation. Up next, we'll look at project proposals and project charters, two types of documents that can set you up for success early on.
