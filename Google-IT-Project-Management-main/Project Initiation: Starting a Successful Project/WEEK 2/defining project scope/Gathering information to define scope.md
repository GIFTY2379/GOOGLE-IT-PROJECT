Gathering information to define scope

In this lesson, you are learning to define project scope status and differentiate in-scope, out-of-scope, and scope creep factors that affect reaching the project goal. Let’s 
focus here on how to identify vital elements of a project’s scope and examine the right questions to ask in order to define it. 

Asking scope-defining questions
Imagine that while working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing 
further instruction. In this initial handoff from the manager, you are missing a lot of information. How do you even know what to ask?

Let’s quickly recap the concept of scope. The scope provides the boundaries for your project. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a
schedule for the project. 

In the situation we just described, here are some questions you might ask your manager in order to get the information you need to define the scope of the project:

Key takeaway
Taking the time to ask questions and ensure that you understand the scope of the project will help reduce expenses, rework, frustration, and confusion. Make sure you understand
the who, what, when, where, why, and how as it applies to the scope. If you are missing any of that information, focus your questions on those elements. The initiation phase of
the project sets the foundation for the project, so ensuring that you understand the scope and expectations during this stage is essential.
