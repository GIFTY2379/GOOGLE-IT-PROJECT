In this activity, you will practice creating OKRs (objectives and key results) for a project. OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. Objectives
define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome, while key results define how you will measure that outcome.

As a project manager, creating OKRs can help you clarify both your overall project goals and the deliverables you’ll need to accomplish those goals. You can also create 
project-level OKRs to help motivate your team.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access
the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 


Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions. 

Wonder City is a mid-sized city where increasing growth and traffic are impacting quality of life. According to a recent market assessment, the region’s population is expected
to double in the next five years. Job growth is also expected to increase by 48%. This growth will impact street networks, parking and mobility.

Wonder City has several city-wide objectives related to reducing traffic congestion and improving the city’s infrastructure. In order to support these city-wide objectives, 
the Wonder City Transportation Authority (WCTA) will be launching five new bus lines. This initiative has been nicknamed Project Move It.

You have been hired as the project manager for this initiative. As the project manager, you will set OKRs to help clarify the project goals and define what needs to be done 
in order to deliver a successful project.

Here is some additional information about the project:

1. The project needs to be completed within two years.

2. Community member buy-in and support for the locations of the new bus lines will be required.

3. The project must adhere to all government regulations.

4. Stops along the new bus lines must connect neighboring suburbs to downtown and public resource facilities.

5. Bus lines must service at least 50% of the most densely-populated areas of Wonder City.

6. The project is intended to help improve wait times and increase ridership.

7. The plan includes a marketing campaign to promote the new lines.
