We discussed quality management, where we learned the four steps to ensuring quality, which includes setting quality standards, quality planning, quality assurance,
and quality control. 

We covered continuous improvement and how to use data-driven strategies such as DMAIC—which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, control—and PDCA—which
which stands for a plan, do, check, act—in order to work toward continuous improvements. 

We learned how to conduct and use retrospectives as a tool for future improvements and how to facilitate positive conversation and encourage feedback from your
team members in order to avoid mistakes later on in future projects.

I'm really proud of how far you've come, and I hope you are too. I hope you take a moment to admire your progress and applaud yourself. In the next module,
you'll learn about the importance of gathering data and how to make data-driven decisions.
