 So what did we learn? We learned that data plays a key part in the success of any organization and it impacts your role as a project manager. We've learned what
 data is, the value that data provides for your projects, and how it empowers you to achieve your project's goals.
 
 You learned about the different types of data, like metrics and projections, and how to identify and discern what information to watch for and to communicate to
 stakeholders.
 
 We also discussed how important data is to help you make informed decisions and showcase areas where you and your team are being most effective, flagging potential
 risks, and opportunities to advance.
 
 We reviewed data visualization and data tools and learned that facts are usually easier to remember when there's a visual alongside it. We also discussed ways for
 you to present all of your insights to stakeholders, colleagues, and customers. So let's pause so you can give yourself a high five for coming this far.
