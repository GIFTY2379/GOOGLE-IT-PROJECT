In this last set of videos, I went over how to formally close a project and explained why closing a project is important. I defined what it means for a project
to be complete, detailed the steps in the closing phase, and I demonstrated how to create documentation for closing a project. 

We learned that project closing, when applied appropriately, is a combination of assurance that the work has been completed, confirmation that all agreed upon
project management processes have been executed, and formal recognition that the project requirements have been met and everyone agrees that the project is,
in fact, done.

We discussed different aspects of the closing process, including conducting retrospectives for your team, why impact reporting matters, and the purpose of a
project closeout report. That was the end.

Throughout the entire course, you learned how to run a project. This is no small feat. We discussed that tracking a project helps to build and maintain
confidence within your team that the project will be delivered on time, on budget, and in-scope.

We learned about different external factors that impact a project like dependencies, risk, and changes. We discussed how to communicate those factors to your
team members. We covered data, how to gather it, how to use it to inform decision-making processes, and how to discern and explain project data using effective
presentation techniques. 

We discussed how projects, programs, and portfolios relate to each other and their key differences. We also learned about the elements of teamwork and how a
successful project manager leads a team to success with positive influence and ethical considerations. 

At this point, you should have a good understanding of how to organize and facilitate meetings to ensure project success and how to communicate effective 
project status updates to stakeholders.
