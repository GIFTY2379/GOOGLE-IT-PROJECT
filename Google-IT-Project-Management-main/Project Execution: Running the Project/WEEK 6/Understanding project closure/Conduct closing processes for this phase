Conduct closing processes for this phase

Put together closing documentation
Compile your closeout report and add the notes from your recent team retrospective. Together, these documents represent the consensus of your team regarding what
went well and what needs improvement.





Refer to prior documentation
Revisit the statement of work for the scene, as well as the risk register and the project plan. Check that your team completed each of their assigned tasks, 
and that you delivered on all of the required work.




Complete any necessary follow-up work
Ensure that your team follows up on the action items that you established during your retrospective. Follow up with your outside vendors to uncover any
final pieces of feedback about the project phase.




Conduct administrative closure of the procurement process
The scene required some specialized vendors and it’s time to close out their contracts and pay them. It’s also time to return props that were on loan from
a science fiction museum.
