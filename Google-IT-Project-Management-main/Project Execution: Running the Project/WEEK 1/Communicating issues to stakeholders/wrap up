You've reached the end of this section. We've covered some really important aspects of implementation, tracking, and quality in this course. We discussed why the
tracking process is essential to building confidence in your team and how important knowing the progress of a project is.

To communicate this, you learned how to use various types of tracking methods, like Gantt charts, roadmaps, and burndown charts. You also learned that roadmaps are
suitable for tracking high-level milestones, Gantt charts are useful for projects with many dependencies, and burndown charts are better for more granular, 
task-oriented projects that are on a tight schedule. 

You learned which items to track using these charts, including costs, the status of key tasks, progress toward milestones, incoming action items, and important 
decisions. We explored risks and dependencies, including techniques like brainstorming to create risk registers, and we took you through the ROAM technique, which
stands for resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated. You also learned about changes and dependencies and how they impact a project.

We also discussed managing and communicating those risks, changes, and dependencies.
