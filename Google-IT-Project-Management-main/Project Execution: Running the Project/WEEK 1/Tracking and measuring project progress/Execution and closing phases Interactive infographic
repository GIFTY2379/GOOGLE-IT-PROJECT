Understanding execution and closing


Create a project status report
During the planning phase, you made a project plan for Plant Pals. Now that the project is underway and you’re sending out test batches, you’ll create a 
status report to summarize progress, identify problems, and keep stakeholders informed.




Conduct a ROAM analysis
Your status report reveals ongoing issues with product and service quality. To help your team stay organized, you’ll categorize them as resolved, owned,
accepted, or mitigated. Knowing how you’ll handle these issues keeps you on track to complete the project.





Write an escalation email
Removing barriers to progress is one of your most important tasks as project manager—but you can’t always do it alone. When your team encounters a major issue,
you’ll write an escalation email to get support and advice from senior stakeholders.





Create a presentation for your team
When you’re done shipping test batches, you’ll present the results of a customer satisfaction survey to your team. To make your presentation engaging and
memorable, you’ll tell a story using key data points, summarizing takeaways, and outlining next steps.





Plan a meeting to discuss open issues
After your presentation, you’ll meet with the team to discuss areas to improve as you prepare for launch. To ensure a focused and productive conversation,
you’ll create a meeting agenda that lays out open issues and lists topics for discussion.





Create a report to close the project
After the official Plant Pals launch, you’ll create a project closeout report to document what went well, what went wrong, and how the team solved problems.
The report will help you—and other project managers—as you plan for future projects.
