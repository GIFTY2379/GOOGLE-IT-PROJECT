Wrap-up

We learned all about managing costs and budget. We learned that a project budget is the estimated monetary resources needed to achieve outlined goals and objectives.
We learned that a project budget is much more nuanced than just aiming to save money. It's a success metric that's used to track project performance. 

Remember, it's not desirable to be over budget or under budget. We also learned that cost control involves several stakeholders, sign-off from key stakeholders, and 
actively managing changes.

We definitely went in-depth from procurement and vendor management, which involves obtaining the necessary supplies, materials, and external resources for your project's
success. We learned the important steps:

initiating, 
selecting, 
contract writing, 
control, and 
completing.

We now know that procurement will be different depending on which methodology you're using. An Agile procurement approach differs from a traditional procurement approach.
It's more relationship-based because the negotiation stays open the whole time. 

An Agile procurement requires more frequent communication with vendors because the contracts maybe reviewed and adjusted regularly. The traditional approach is typically
done during the procurement stage and ends there. We learned about NDAs, RFPs, and SoWs, and we created an SoW together. 

Finally, you learned a bit about how to think critically when it comes to ethics in procurement. You learned how to adhere to a code of ethics, when to use your own
judgment, and the importance of researching the ethics of procurement.

Nice job. Next up, you're going to learn about different types of risks, how to identify risk, and how to mitigate risk.
