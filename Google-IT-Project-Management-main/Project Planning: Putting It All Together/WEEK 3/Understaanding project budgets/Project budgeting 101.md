Project budgeting 101

A project budget is the estimated monetary resources needed to achieve a project's goals and objectives. In previous lessons, we covered a wide range of information
related to project budgets. Let’s recap to make sure you have the information and tools you need to create and manage your project’s budget.

Budgets are created in the initiation phase of your project. As with any other project management document, you need to continue to review and control the budget throughout
the life cycle of your project. Your budget is more than just how much it will cost to complete the project—it is a helpful tool to reference when communicating with 
stakeholders and can double as a tracker for your project’s progress. Budgets also help control your costs and act as the baseline for the financial portion of the project.



Project budgeting best practices
Here are a few tips to consider when creating your project budget:

1. Reference historical data: Your project may be similar to a previous project your organization has worked on. It is important to review how that project’s budget was
handled, find out what went well, and learn from any previous mistakes.

2. Utilize your team, mentors, or manager: Get into the habit of asking for your team to double check your work to give you additional sets of eyes on your documents.

3. Time-phase your budget: Time-phased budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the projected timeline in which those expenses are planned to take
place. By looking at your tasks against a timeline, you can track and compare planned versus actual costs over time and manage changes to your budget as necessary.

4.Check, check, and double check: Make sure that your budget is accurate and error-free. Your budget will likely require approval from another department, such as
finance or senior management, so do your best to ensure that it is as straightforward to understand as possible and that all of your calculations are correct.


Categorize different types of costs
There are different types of costs that your project will incur. For example, you may need to account for both direct costs and indirect costs in your project budget.
Categorize these different types of costs in your budget so that you can ensure you are meeting the requirements of your organization and customer. 

Direct costs
These are costs for items that are necessary in order to complete your project. These costs can include:

1. Wages and salaries of employees and contractors 

2. Materials costs

3. Equipment rental costs

4. Software licenses 

5. Project-related travel and transportation costs

6. Staff training

Indirect costs
These are costs for items which do not directly lead to the completion of your project but are still essential for the project team to do their work. They are also
referred to as overhead costs. These costs can include:

1. Administrative costs

2. Utilities

3. Insurance 

4. General office equipment 

5. Security


Develop a baseline budget
A baseline budget is an estimate of project costs that you start with at the beginning of your project. Once you have created a budget for your project and gotten it
approved, you should publish this baseline and use it to compare against actual performance progress. This will give you insight into how your project budget is doing 
and allow you to make informed adjustments.


It is important to continually monitor your project budget and make changes if necessary. Be aware that budget updates can require the same approvals as your initial
budget. Also, you should “re-baseline” your budget if you make significant changes. Re-baselining refers to when you update or modify a project's baseline as a result 
of any approved change to the schedule, cost, or deliverable content. For example, if you have a significant change in your project scope, your budget will likely be
impacted. In this instance, you would need to re-baseline in order to adhere to a realistic budget.


Key takeaways
Budgeting in the project management world is a complex process involving many different parties and documentation, but following the best practices described in this 
reading can help break it down. Remember to use historical data and time-phasing, and reach out to your team for support. Make sure you are capturing all of the
components of your budget, including direct and indirect costs. Finally, be sure to baseline your budget so you know where your money is being used and when.
These tips can help set you up for budget management success.
