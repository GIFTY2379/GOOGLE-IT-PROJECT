Introduction: Managing budgeting and procurement

Let's discuss money. As mentioned before, a lot of project management skills may overlap with common skills that you already use in your everyday life, and you may 
already have some budgeting experience. Budgeting in the project management world is a complex process involving many different parties and documentation. 

I'm going to teach you how to create and manage a real-world project budget. We'll discuss the many components of a budget and how stakeholders play a role in the 
budgeting process. You'll learn about the importance of procurement in project management. If you don't know what that means yet, sit tight. You will understand that
concept soon enough. You will also learn about vendor management and procurement in both the Agile and the traditional methodology settings.

There will be several new concepts around legal and contractual documentation introduced throughout, such as NDAs, RFPs, and SoWs. You'll learn that project managers are
fluent in acronyms, and soon you will be too. I will explain each of these acronyms coming up. We'll also teach you about the role that legal teams and ethics play
in procurement. I'll give you a hint: it's a big one.

Starting a new project and sourcing materials and vendors without considering the ethical implications can get project managers into hot water.
