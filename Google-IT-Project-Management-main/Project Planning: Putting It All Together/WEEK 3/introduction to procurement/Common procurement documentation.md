Common procurement documentation

There are a few important documents that help a project manager navigate through each phase of procurement. For instance, in the initiating phase, a project manager will
create a nondisclosure agreement, otherwise known as an NDA. In the selecting phase, a project manager creates a request for proposal, or an RFP.

In the contracting phase, a statement of work or an SOW is created. Now let's learn more about these acronyms and documents. The first important document is a
nondisclosure agreement, also known as an NDA. NDA is a standard within a lot of companies, and it's best practice to ask external contract workers to sign an NDA.

The purpose of an NDA is to keep confidential information within the organization. So for instance, if a company is using some kind of proprietary technology on a project
or preparing for a sensitive product launch, they want to ensure that any conversations or information surrounding that technology doesn't leak out to competitors or to 
the public before the company is ready to launch.

For example, in Project Plant Pals, vendors might be required to sign an NDA because the project is new to market and hasn't been made public yet. Then we have a request 
for proposal or an RFP, a document that outlines the details and requirements of an organization's project to be passed on to vendors.

RFPs are used to solicit bids from vendors so that you can then select which vendor might be the best for your project. An RFP is widely used within different departments 
in a company and across various industries. An RFP typically includes an overview of the project, the desired outcomes, and goals, budget, deadlines, milestones, and
contact information so each vendor can get back to you with a detailed proposal of how they plan to tackle the job.

When creating an RFP, make sure to add the following headers to your document. The overview. Treat this section like a general summary. What is the purpose of this project?
What problems will it solve? What new doors will it open for the company? Your goals. What are some measurable results you can aim to achieve throughout the process?
Next is the scope of work. What are the specifics of the project? How are you going to achieve those goals and make sure the project launches successfully?
Then include milestones.

Make sure to highlight the key milestones your project will include. Lastly, include submission requirements, like, "Please submit the RFP as a presentation and include
three prototypes," as well as the questions you'd like the vendor to answer as part of the process. This helps you properly assess potential vendors.

For instance, you might want to know what issues a contractor sees up front or how the costs will break down. After the RFP is sent out, various vendors will review it,
and if they feel they can fulfill your project's needs, they'll provide a proposal.

For example, you may create an RFP for Project Plant Pals to source plant providers. In this case, you want to send out RFPs to all possible plant providers to ensure
that you're getting the best price, quality, and overall value. 

You may hear RFP being used as a verb, as in, "Has this been RFP'd yet?" That's really a way of asking if an RFP has been sent out to vendors yet. It's important to note 
that both the NDA and the RFP are fixed and remain the same throughout the process. This means that there's not a lot of room for customization, and it won't be changed
once it's submitted. Lastly, there's a third important document called a Statement of Work, or an SOW. An SOW is sent after the vendor is selected and evolves as the
project goes on.
