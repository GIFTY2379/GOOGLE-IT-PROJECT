Finding more information

Throughout this course, you will learn the basics of project management. We will provide a lot of information through videos and readings. But sometimes, you may need to 
look things up on your own for additional learning. Things change fast in this growing field, so it is critical to do your own research so you can stay up-to-date on what 
is new. 

Here are some helpful project management resources available online:

The Project Management Institute is the leading association for those in project, program, or portfolio management professions. Their website provides guides, industry 
standards, articles, templates, job boards, certifications, and more to help support professionals in these careers.

The Scrum Guide defines Scrum, a technique used in Agile project management. You’ll learn about the framework later in this program. This guide describes Scrum’s roles, 
events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. You can also find hundreds of free resources to learn more about Scrum at Scrum.org Resources.

Digital documents, spreadsheets, and presentations 
You will complete activities using a variety of digital documents, spreadsheets, and presentation templates. These templates align with the document types that project 
managers often use to create, edit, and collaborate with their team and organization. Digital documents make it easy to collaborate in real time and stay organized.

If you’re not familiar with these types of tools, check out the course Resources.
