The importance of setting milestones


So you've learned that a milestone is an important point within the project schedule that highlights progress and usually marks the completion of a deliverable or phase in
the project. But now, let's talk about why setting milestones within your project is so important.

While it might seem tempting to make a quick to-do list and get on with the project, it's really important that you take the time and effort to break your project down 
piece by piece. Here's why. First, setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require. 

The act of setting milestones forces you to break your project down into more manageable chunks. The further you go, the better you'll be able to see how much work will be
needed to meet the project goals. At first glance, it might seem simple to launch a new website, but it might be more work than you think. If you break that deliverable 
down into milestones and those milestones into tasks, you will have a better sense of the true amount of work that needs to be done. 

This will help you better manage the project workload. Another reason milestones are so great is that they can help keep your project on track. When you set a milestone, you
assign clear deadlines for when certain project deliverables need to be completed. Then, as you work through the execution phase, you can look back at these deadlines to make
sure that the project is progressing at the right pace.

A third reason you'll want to set milestones is that they help you uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals. For example,
if you realize that reaching a milestone will require more tasks than you'd anticipated, you might ask a stakeholder for permission to reduce the scope of the project and
cut down on the number of tasks. And finally, there's one more reason milestones are so important. 

Actually reaching milestones can seriously motivate your team and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders. With big projects that go on for months, you'll want to keep
the teams motivation high. A milestone signifies the completion of an important chunk of work and provides a moment of celebration for the team, even if there's more
work ahead. Milestones also serve as a great check-in point to highlight your progress to stakeholders.

It gives them the opportunity to see the work that's been completed so far and lets them see everything is on track and up to their standards. It's also important to remember
that milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order because, usually, reaching the next milestone is dependent on completing a previous milestone. 

Think about this in terms of Project Plant Pals at Office Green. As we discussed earlier, in order to launch a website for a new plant service, there are a few milestones you
need to hit, like securing approval of a website design, completing development of the website, and implementing user feedback. These milestones must happen in this order.

Here's why. The web developer can't build the website if the design hasn't been approved by stakeholders, and you can't implement feedback from user testing if there's no 
website to test. So we know it's important to reach milestones in sequential order, but it's just as important that you reach them on time.

If the team misses the mark to complete a deliverable tied to a specific milestone, it could set back your project schedule, meaning your team might need to work overtime
or add additional resources to catch up. 

For example, if you need to secure stakeholder approval on a website design by Friday but the web designer hasn't completed the design yet, you might have to wait until
after the weekend to secure stakeholder approval. This will delay the start of the development phase, giving your team less time to build the website. Even worse, this
delay could affect the project budget if completing this deliverable directly ties to a payment from the client. 

If you miss the deadline, you will likely delay receipt of that payment. You might even risk losing the payment altogether. Though deadlines are sometimes flexible, it's
important to be extra mindful of milestones where the deadline is non-negotiable.
