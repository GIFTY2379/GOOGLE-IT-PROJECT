Understanding tasks and milestones

As we've discussed throughout this program, the project manager is responsible for assigning work to the team and keeping track of the project's progress. When we discuss 
assigning work, we'll use a few key terms, project milestones, and project tasks. Let's break these down. A project milestone is an important point within the project
schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.

These are significant checkpoints in your project, and keeping track of them helps ensure that your project is on schedule to meet its goals. For example, a milestone might 
include completing the first draft of a report, and the goal may be to ultimately publish the report. 

Another example of a milestone is receiving sign off, or approval from your customer on a major deliverable. Let's discuss how milestones differ from project tasks. A project
task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time. 

The work of a project is broken down into many different tasks. In order to reach a milestone, you and your team must complete multiple tasks. For example, if a milestone is
completing the first draft of a report, the tasks required to get to that milestone might include hiring a writer, conducting research, and drafting different sections of
the report. Let's imagine milestones and tasks in the context of Project Plant Pals at Office Green.

One of your project deliverables is to launch a website for your new service, where customers will be able to place orders and get customer support.

Some of the milestones leading up to that launch will include securing approval on the website design and implementing feedback from user testing. To achieve those milestones,
your team needs to complete multiple project tasks. For example, in order to reach the design milestone, your website designer will need to create initial mockups of the 
proposed website design.

You'll need to review those mockups, and the designer will need to implement your feedback.

Each of these items is a project task, and you won't reach your milestone until they're complete.

To review, milestones are important points within the project schedule, and project tasks are activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time to help reach
those milestones. Milestones and project tasks are interconnected. Tasks ladder up to milestones, which are crucial for project tracking.
