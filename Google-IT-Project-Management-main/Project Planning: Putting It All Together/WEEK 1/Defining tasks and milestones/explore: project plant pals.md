Understand the planning phase
learn about the planning phase for Project Plant Pals.


Get started on the Plant Pals Operations and Training plan
In the initiation phase, you made a project charter for the Plant Pals Operations and Training plan. Now you’re ready for the planning phase. You’ll use the charter to create
sustainable fulfillment and delivery protocols and support your customer base.


Identify major milestones and assign task owners
First, you’ll define the work your team needs to do for the plan—like sourcing materials and training employees. Creating a work breakdown structure (WBS) diagram and 
spreadsheet will help you identify and organize major milestones and assign task owners.



Map project schedule and tasks using a Gantt chart
Next, you’ll add those tasks and milestones—along with due dates and durations—to a Gantt chart. This chart helps you clarify and map out task timelines and dependencies, so
your team knows what to do at each stage



Estimate costs and create a budget
Once you’ve set your schedule, it’s time to estimate the costs of your milestones and tasks. Your budget should include both one-time and recurring expenses—as well as a 
buffer to cover any overages.



Create a Statement of Work (SoW)
When your team hires a vendor to complete a project milestone, you’ll create a Statement of Work (SoW). This legal document defines what you need from the vendor (and what
they need from you), so everyone knows what’s expected.



Create a risk management plan
Next, you’ll assess potential risks to the budget and schedule, like staffing shortages or shipping delays. Identifying, evaluating, and preparing for specific risks helps
you keep the project on track if things go wrong.



Create a communication plan
When it’s time to train employees, you’ll need to manage various communications among stakeholders. Your communication plan will track senders and recipients, communication
goals, key dates, and other details. That way, everyone gets the right information at the right time.



Organize the project artifacts
Finally, to keep your project artifacts organized, you’ll create a project plan in a central location. Your team members and stakeholders can use it to find project 
documents, and you can refer to it when you plan future projects.
