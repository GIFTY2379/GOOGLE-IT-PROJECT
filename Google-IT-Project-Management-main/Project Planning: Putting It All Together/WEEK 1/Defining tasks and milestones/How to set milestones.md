How to set milestones

so you know that milestones are pretty important. They help give you a clear picture of the amount of work required. They help your project stay on track, uncover areas
where you might need additional resources, motivate your teammates, and show progress to your stakeholders. 

So now, let's talk about identifying milestones within your project and how you can set deadlines for each one. The first step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your 
project as a whole. It helps to refer back to your project charter to remind yourself of the project goal. Then, make a list of what your team needs to do to achieve that 
goal. 

The big items that indicate progress are your milestones. These are the key points within the project schedule that signify the completion of a project deliverable or a
phase in the project. Smaller items, like any item that a stakeholder wouldn't need to review, for example, are tasks. You'll plan for these once you've separated them out
from the milestones.

So let's go back to our Office Green example. One of the project deliverables is a new website. And as we determined earlier, some milestones through our Office Green website
scenario include securing approval of website design, completing development of the website, and implementing user feedback. Mocking up initial designs or building a landing
page are smaller items on your list, so those are marked as tasks.

Try to keep in mind that some projects might have many milestones, while others might just have two or three. There's no one right number of milestones to set â€”the number
will vary from project to project. Once you've determined your milestones, the next step is to assign each one a deadline.

Reaching each of your milestones is dependent on the completion of multiple project tasks. So to make sure you give your team a fair amount of time to complete each of those
tasks, you'll need to space your milestones out accordingly. For a larger, months-long project like Project Plant Pals, you shouldn't expect to meet multiple milestones in 
the span of a week.

Mocking up website designs and collecting insights from user testing are big tasks that take time. You need to space milestones out to give your team room to complete their
work. To get a good sense of timing, you can connect with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each milestone and get their estimates for how long these tasks
will take. With those estimates in mind, you can make an informed decision about reasonable deadlines for each milestone.

When you set deadlines for milestones, you will also want to consider the needs of your stakeholders. Ask yourself when they'll expect to see a certain project deliverable, 
and consider the answer when choosing a deadline. Your stakeholders will want to see regular indications that the team is making progress, and milestones are a great way to 
show that progress. 

So to recap, you set milestones by looking at your project as a whole and pulling out important checkpoints that show progress. Then you assign deadlines to each milestone 
while keeping the needs of your stakeholders top of mind.
