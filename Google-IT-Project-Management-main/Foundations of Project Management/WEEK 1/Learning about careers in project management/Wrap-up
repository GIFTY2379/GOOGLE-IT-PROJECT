We started by discussing how project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve
the desired outcome. 

Then we learned that project management is alive in nearly every industry and company. So you're working on an incredibly useful and versatile certification. 

We also learned what a project is: A unique endeavor and temporary pursuit, carefully planned out to achieve a particular goal. Hopefully by now, you're familiar
with the idea that every project has a defined time frame, cost, scope, and dedicated resources. We've covered some broad concepts and key terms that will help 
you become a successful project manager, and we've gone over how to search for jobs when that time comes. 

We've also discussed how to effectively translate your past experiences into talking points for why you'll be a successful project manager. We talked about how you 
can transfer skills from your previous job into your new project management role, and how that'll really set you apart.

Everything from juggling a to-do list to budgeting for a loved one's birthday party demonstrates that you probably already have some of the skills to be a
phenomenal project manager. But no worries if you don't. We're starting from scratch here. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills, but also the 
experience, and knowledge to find the role you want. Whether that's contract work, internships, or general project management positions, you'll be able to figure
out what's the best fit for you.

And as we go forward, I want to encourage you to keep thinking about what kind of work you might like to do in the future. And let's not forget the most exciting
news we learned about project management: just about everyone needs a project manager. This position's in high demand, and that demand just keeps growing.
