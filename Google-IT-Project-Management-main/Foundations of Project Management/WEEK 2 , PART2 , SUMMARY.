Key competencies: Flexibility and handling ambiguity

1. Enabling decision-making

When you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness.

2. Communicating and sescalating

When escalation is required, try to approach management with bot the problem and the potential solution or suggestions.

3. Strong organizational skills

a. Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)
b. Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)
c. Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)
d. Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)


4. Flexibility

a. Assess external constraints: Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.
b. Plan for risks and challenges: if you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. You can also assess risks by looking at 
historical data. Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly.
c. Consider alternative scenarios: Review all of your project’s tasks and the relationships among them. Find tasks that could “float”, meaning that a change in their delivery
would not affect the project’s overall success or impact its timeline. This can help you determine where you can change the order of tasks or juggle resources if needed.



                                       Handling ambiguity

a. Keep calm
b. Express empathy: As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during time of ambiguity 
(support them to struggle with it).
c. Communicate what you know clearly.
d. Assess, document, and communicate any assumptions you make when planning a project.
e. Make decisions and stick to them
f. Trust the expertise of your team.



Need to understand what their unique needs.

Help others making decisions, and coming to conclusions together.

Project managers: hire the experts and help put all the pieces of the project together. Project managers don’t need to be experts in every field.

To be a successful project manager at any organization—regardless of whether you have worked there previously—it is essential to master the skills, tools, and techniques of
project management.

Your role as a project manager is to communicate with your stakeholders, clarify objectives, and set expectations. Trust your team to handle the details of each project task
and communicate with you when there’s an issue. Through your direct communication and strategic approach to problem-solving, you can provide solutions and help remove barriers 
for your team. This is where you add value!

Real case 1:

A co-worker is responsible for researching and providing you with a list of potential venues for a retirement party. For the last three weeks, they have been telling you 
they will complete the list by “the end of the week (EOW).” When you check in with them at the beginning of each of the weeks, they tell you they didn’t get around to 
completing it but that it will be done by the current week.



Solution

Talk to your co-worker about the overall schedule for the retirement party, and explain to them how selecting a venue as soon as possible is critical to the success of the 
overall event and will determine what the date of the party will be.

Ask your co-worker about their current workload and see if there is anything you can do to free up their schedule. You can also offer to get someone else to help them, 
if needed.

Midweek, consider sending your co-worker a gentle reminder about their end of week commitment and ask how it’s coming along.







Real case 2:

Jot down a list of the most valuable soft and hard skills required to be a successful project manager and describe how each skill contributes to a project manager’s success.

a. Enabling decision making: The ability to enable decision making on the team, or gather decisions from the appropriate leader is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve 
their goals. As a project manager, you will need to enable decisions frequently.

b. Communicating and escalating: As a project manager, you’ll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. And you need to know when it is appropriate to 
escalate, so that critical issues are raised and addressed as soon as possible to reduce negative impact on a project.

c. Remaining flexible: As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key. Plans will change — even with careful, upfront planning. As a project 
manager being flexible is critical to be able to course correct and adapt when the unexpected happens.

d. Organizational Skills: Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize the core elements of a project and ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked. 
A project manager needs to be organized so that they can manage a project and all of its moving parts.






Hard skills:


a. Scheduling: Project managers need to learn how to assign tasks in the correct order, at the correct time, and estimate how long they take in order to be able to create a good
timeline for the project, and to be able to show how long a project is expected to take.

b. Budgeting: Project managers need to understand how to forecast and manage a budget in order to show how much a project is going to cost.

c. Risk Management: Project managers need to be able to assess potential risks of projects, and determine mitigation strategies so that they are better prepared when the project
encounters unexpected obstacles.

d. Good with tooling (e.g. spreadsheets): Spreadsheets and other technology (like project planning and presentation software) can help with tracking and reporting on the many 
different moving parts of a project. These tools can improve the productivity of a project manager.
