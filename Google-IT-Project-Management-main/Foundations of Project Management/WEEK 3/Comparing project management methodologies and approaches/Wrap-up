So what did you think? Hopefully, this introduction to a few of the core project management methodologies and hearing from a Googler about the way we approach
project management here at Google has you interested and excited to keep on learning. 

One of the great things about project management is that it can be really creative and present you with challenging problems to solve that have a rewarding impact. 
You get to work with teams full of interesting, skilled, and dedicated people who help with the problem-solving and idea-generating process. 

Every project is an opportunity to learn and try something new. Waterfall, Agile, and Lean Six Sigma are solid foundations from which to build your understanding 
of project management.

Each methodology has its own set of rules, values, and processes. There is no such thing as a right or a wrong methodology. There is no one-size-fits-all approach 
to take, and there is almost no limit to the number of ways you can blend different approaches to fit the needs of your project.

Your goal in choosing a methodology is to maximize the use of resources and time. The method, or combination of methods, will help you reach your goal in the most 
efficient and effective way. 

This might feel like choice overload right here, but hang in there. With time and practice, you will become more comfortable with the benefits and limits of 
different methodologies, and you'll be able to approach your project assignments with confidence. Next, you'll build on these foundations by learning how an 
organization structure and culture can impact the way you manage your project.
