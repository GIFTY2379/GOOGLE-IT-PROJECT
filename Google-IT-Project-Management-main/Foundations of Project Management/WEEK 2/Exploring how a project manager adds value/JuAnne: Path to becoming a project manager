My path to being a project manager really started as a business systems analyst. I was writing requirements or gathering requirements for our customers and 
translating them into documentation for our engineers so that they could implement it.

Through that process, I became a project manager. I started to manage the timelines, manage the tasks, understand all the pieces, and who needed to be involved. 

There you go, you have a project manager. I think the funnest part about being a project manager is really working with people. You get to meet all different kinds 
of people, different personalities. Sometimes you get to travel to places to meet them but even when you don't, just meeting new people and understanding how we 
interact, how people interact and behave is fascinating.


I think if you build a relationship, focus on the relationship, and really understand what their style, where they're coming from, what their concerns are, it will
help your working relationship much better. You can communicate with them in the style that's necessary. You can work with them in the style that's more receptive 
to them and that would just make the project better all around.
