Ellen: Traits of a successful project manager


I love project management because I really like this idea that you can do more together as a team with a group of people than you could do alone. By bringing in
a bunch of people together and getting organized, getting aligned around a common goal, We can do some pretty amazing things.

I think a successful project manager is somebody who really knows how to pull together a group of people. To me, there's really two parts of project management.
One is this laser-like focus on executing on this goal, but then the other part is the people. So a successful project manager can do both. 

When I first started managing project managers, it was really about everyone works on their own project. How do I just guide them, give them guidance and help
them with their projects. Over the years, I've shifted to mentoring on project management, to mentoring project managers. What I mean by that is, it's different.

I'm no longer saying, "Here's what you should do on your project." I'm really trying to help them think about how to think about their projects. One of the things
that I think about a lot as I'm building a project management team is having a really diverse set of folks with different backgrounds, different experiences.

We're a global company, so we're really trying to make sure we are a global team as well. When I talk about diversity of background and experience, it really is
about working in different types of environments with different types of teams.

When I chat with new project managers and they say like, "How do I continue to grow as a project manager?" My answer is, work on different projects, work on as 
many projects as you can, but don't be afraid to try different areas, different domains, work with different people. With every project you work on, you're going
to really learn something.
