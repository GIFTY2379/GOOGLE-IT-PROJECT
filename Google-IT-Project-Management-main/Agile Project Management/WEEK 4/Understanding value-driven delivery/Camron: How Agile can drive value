My favorite thing about Agile has got to be the flexibility. So when you're making most of the decisions at the beginning, when you know the least, not all those
decisions might be right. Some will, but probably all of them won't be. So with Agile, it's a framework and a mindset that is open to that change that embraces it.
It welcomes it as you learn more. Agile gives you built in opportunities to make changes. An important aspect of Agile is incremental delivery.

You're delivering little bits over the course of a long period of time.

To contrast that, you could think of Waterfallâ€”that's when you deliver everything at once to the customer at the end. In a Waterfall project, you have to wait and
wait and wait until the very end to get everything, and perhaps you're waiting days, months, years, and you cannot extract any value out of it until the very end 
until the product is delivered.

I think that makes sense for a house. I think that makes sense for a car.

I cannot give someone parts of a car and have them start getting value out of it

because a car has certain safety requirements. For things that take longer to figure out, for more challenging design issues, you don't have to sacrifice the entire
project for that one last bit. If you built 90% of the project and you can ship it, go ahead.

Agile lets you extract that value. That way people can use that 90% while you're trying to figure out that last ten. And then hopefully you have an ecosystem where 
it's okay to deploy or release that last 10% down the line. 

Change is never free. Because you've already communicated plans, you've already made estimates, you already have some work in progress. Then if you're going to 
change that, you're going to lose a little bit. Is that change within your threshold or your budget to be able to adapt to get it right or get it better. 
It's not always about it being perfect. It's about it being good.
