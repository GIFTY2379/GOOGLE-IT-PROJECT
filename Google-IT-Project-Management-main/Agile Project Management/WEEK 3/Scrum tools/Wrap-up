We spent a lot of time covering one of the most important parts of Scrum: the Product Backlog. We learned about refining the Backlog and the importance of relative
effort estimation using methods like T-shirt sizes and story points. We identified the five important Scrum events, which are the Sprint itself, Sprint Planning, 
the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. We learned about when each of these take place and what their purposes entail. 

We discussed visual learning by using tools like burndown charts and Kanban boards. We also explored tools like Jira, Asana, and Trello, which make it easy to keep
your workflow transparent and keep every team member up-to-date on the progress made throughout the Sprint. I really want to congratulate you on making it this far. 

You've already learned and accomplished so much, and I'm excited for you to continue learning.
