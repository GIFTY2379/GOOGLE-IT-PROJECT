Introduction: Implementing Scrum


In this video, we'll complete our overview of Scrum and dive deep into the setup and day-to-day execution of a Scrum Team. We will go beyond what is provided in 
the official Scrum Guide and share the most popular tools, methods, tips, and tricks for working with a Scrum Team.

I'll discuss how to manage your Product Backlog, which contains all of the features, requirements, and activities associated with deliverables to achieve the goal
of the project. Once we have a Backlog, one of the trickiest parts of Scrum is estimation. 

We'll learn what T-shirt sizes and story points have to do with Scrum as we discuss a technique called relative effort estimation.

Retrospective.

JIRA, Asana, Trello, Kanban boards, and more, which will help your workflow stay organized and transparent.
