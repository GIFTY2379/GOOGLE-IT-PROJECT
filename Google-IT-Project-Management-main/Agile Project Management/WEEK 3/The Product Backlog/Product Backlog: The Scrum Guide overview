Product Backlog: The Scrum Guide overview

Product Backlog and Product Goal

In this lesson, you are learning about an important Scrum artifact: the Product Backlog. To recap, the Product Backlog is an ordered list of what needs to be done
to improve a product. It is the single authoritative source for items the Scrum Team works on. During Product Backlog refinement, items are broken down and further
defined by adding details. These details can vary, but often include such attributes as description, value, order, estimate, and size. 

The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team, and it is included in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog defines what tasks will 
fulfill the Product Goal.

To learn more about the Product Backlog and Product Goal, please read this overview from the 2020 Scrum Guide.
