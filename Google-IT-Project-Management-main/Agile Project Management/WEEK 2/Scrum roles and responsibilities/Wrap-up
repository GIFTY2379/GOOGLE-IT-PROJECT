You're on your way to becoming a Scrum expert. Throughout these videos, we've extensively reviewed a theory in the Agile framework called Scrum. As a refresher,
Scrum is the most common framework that uses an Agile approach, but there are others, like Kanban or Lean. We discussed those approaches in previous videos.

I introduced you to every Scrum Team member's source of truth, the Scrum Guide, which you can always use as a resource. We discussed the Scrum theory, which has
three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. And we explored the five Scrum values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. 

We went over the essential roles on a Scrum Team. You may remember that those roles are the Scrum Master, who ensures the team builds the thing fast; the Product
Owner, who is in charge of building the right thing; and the Development Team, whose role is to ensure the team builds the thing right. 

It's quite a feat that you've gotten this far in the program, so I hope you're really proud of yourself.
