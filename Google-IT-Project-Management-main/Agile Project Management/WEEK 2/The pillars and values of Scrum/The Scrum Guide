The Scrum Guide


In the last video, you learned that the Scrum Guide acts as the main source of truth for Scrum teams and contains everything you need to know about Scrum. You 
also learned that Scrum is a framework within the foundational project management philosophy called Agile. The Scrum Guide defines Scrum as “A framework within 
which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.” This reading will
review the Scrum pillars and values and then provide links to the Scrum Guide and further reading about Scrum. 

Pillars and values 
To recap, every person on a Scrum team subscribes to the three pillars and the five values of Scrum. 

The three pillars of Scrum are: 

Transparency 

Inspection

Adaptation 

The five values of Scrum are: 

1. Courage 

2. Commitment 

3. Focus

4. Openness 

5. Respect 

In order for a team to succeed, it is incredibly important that every team member follow these core pillars and values.

Scrum only has a few rules and practices that are easy to follow. It is also easy to understand. However, Scrum can be challenging to master because mastery
depends
on being able to embody, live, and promote the pillars and values of Scrum.
