Subject: A few questions about tablet logistics


Hi Seydou,

I hope you’re doing well! I have a question for you from Gilly: What’s involved with the installation? We know that the tablets will be sending orders to the 
kitchen via WiFi. But how do restaurants typically handle keeping them charged in during service? Or will they be plugged in the whole time? Do we need to contact
an electrician to wire up the tables?  Should I add "schedule an electrician" to the project plan? 

Thanks!

Peta





Hi Peta,

Actually, yes—wiring the tables is exactly what happens. Once I know the extent of the installation at each location, I'll work with the tablet vendor to get an
electrician in. 

Let me know if there’s anything else!

Seydou





Hi Seydou,

Another question, coming from Carter this time. How will the kitchen be able to update the menus? Can they do it in real time? Like, for instance, if they run out
of a certain dish, can they remove it from the tablets immediately so customers don’t order it?

Thank you!

Peta






Hi Peta,

Yes, this is a standard feature on all current tablet models. If an item is no longer available you’ll be able to update the menu in real time from the admin
back-end of the software, which you can access on the office computer. We just have to run the staff through some training so they know how to do it.

Keep the questions coming!

Seydou






Hi Seydou,

One more question! Will you be involved with setting up our customization and branding? Deanna asked again about making sure the tablet menu interface looks
and feels like our printed hardcopy menus. Do we provide you with a printed version and you design the tablet version? Or do we get blank software and program
the tablet menus ourselves?

Thanks again!

Peta






Hi Peta,

Custom branding, design, and upload are  separate vendor offerings. Terrific Tablets offers these services with some of their packages. If you choose one of 
those packages, then I’ll connect with your marketing department and update the menu interface to match the branding and layout of your menus. 

Happy to help!

Seydou
