Subject: Checking in

Hi Peta,

I wanted to check in quickly, since you’ve already been with us for a month—I can’t believe how quickly the time has flown! I’m really pleased with all the 
progress you’re making!

On that note, I wanted to see if you’d had an opportunity to meet with Omar yet? As the owner and CEO, he’s not typically involved with day-to-day operations, 
but I think it’s worth sharing the project charter with him now that it’s mostly finalized. This will also be a good opportunity for you to build some rapport 
with him, since his buy-in will be important across a lot of the projects you work on. I can introduce you if you want!

Thanks again for all your work—both Gilly and Alex have raved about working with you! I’m so glad you’ve been able to develop a strong working relationship with
them. They’ll also be able to help you work with some of the other General Managers as we try to scale the tablet program to them in the future.

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there’s anything else I can help you with!

Thanks,

Deanna

Hi Deanna,

Thanks so much for checking in and for the kind words. It’s been a pleasure working with Gilly and Alex, as well. And yes, I’d love an intro to Omar if you don't
mind. It would be great to share the project charter with him. 

I did have one question. Carter is understandably very protective of his kitchen staff—is there any additional context you can share that might make it easier 
to build rapport with him? 

I appreciate your help!

Best,

Peta

Hi Peta,

Yes, Carter really tries to ensure that the kitchen can focus on preparing food, but he also tends to get involved in the details and doesn’t easily back down
when he feels the kitchen’s best interests are at stake. Have you met Zane and Larissa, the kitchen managers for the pilot sites? They might be able to help you 
with some of the details that will impact the kitchen. That way, you won’t have to involve Carter in every decision and you’ll have their input or buy-in when
discussing issues that concern the kitchen staff.

Thanks,

Deanna

Thanks Deanna! That helps put things in perspective. I’ll be sure to reach out to Zane and Larissa.

Best,
