Week 2 - Meeting: Software Installation


Below is the transcript of a phone conversation with the following people: 

Peta (Project Manager)

Seydou (Restaurant Consultant)


Peta (Project Manager): Hi Seydou.

Seydou (Restaurant Consultant): Hi Peta! Got some more questions for me?

Peta: Yup! About software integration this time. We need to make sure that the tablet software syncs up with our POS system. How long does that typically take?

Seydou: Not long at all. We add some code to the POS, reboot, and there you go. We can get it done in a few hours.

Peta: Great! It sounds very straightforward. Are there any issues you’ve seen in the past with this process?

Seydou: Well, it depends on what POS software you’re using, and which version. I think you’re on FlatPlate version 3.0. We require 3.0 or higher, and there are
a few other POS systems we work with as well.

Peta: Oh, I’m not sure if we’re on 3.0. I remember thinking when I saw the screen at one of the locations that it looked a little old. What if we’re not on 3.0?

Seydou: Then that means you’d need to update your POS system. That can be done by contacting FlatPlate directly.

Peta: And how long does that take?

Seydou: It depends. Maybe a few days?

Peta: Ok, thanks for the info. I’m going to give Gilly a call and check on that immediately. Thank you!
