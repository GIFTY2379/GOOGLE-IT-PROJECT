Subject: Tablet Contract update

Hi Peta,

I’m working on finalizing the vendor contract with Terrific Tablets and I have a potentially big update for you. They just released a new pricing structure for
their menu tablets and the software.

Previously, they would sell the tablets to the restaurants, and part of that cost would include the menu software—kind of like a one-time licensing fee. That’s
what you and I have been counting on for the rollout. But they’re no longer offering that option. Terrific Tablets is now going forward as a subscription-based
service, which includes hardware, software, support, customization, POS integration, and more as part of a monthly flat rate. I think it’s a much better service 
for us, but it does change the price point.

Now, instead of $200 per tablet for the 40 tablets we need, the subscription that matches our needs would be $300 a month and would cover all 40 tablets, the 
software, 24/7 support, customization—everything. 

So instead of $8000 for using all the tablets in the first year, it will cost us only $3,600, including support. But, that $3,600 will need to be paid every 
year going forward. 

Let me know what you think, and if you want to move ahead with the updated contract terms.

Hi Seydou,

Wow, that is a big change! I guess we’ll need to revise that contract. Since this affects our project budget, and actually changes the tablets from a one-time 
expense to a recurring cost, let me run it by the team. I’ll follow up shortly.

Best,
Peta
