Week 2 - Meeting: Menu and Coupons

Below is the transcript of a phone conversation with the following people: 

Peta (Project Manager)

Deanna (Director of Operations)


Peta: Hi Deanna. How are things?

Deanna: Good! How’s the project coming along?

Peta: Pretty well! I wanted to touch base on when you’ll have the menu items and coupon values you want featured on the tablets. I need to send that content over to
the designer so they can get started with the mock-ups 

Deanna: Yes! Do you know how long it’ll take to upload the content once we have it?

Peta: I was told that once the mock-ups are ready, it’s just a few hours to load everything in, maybe less. But we need to know which items will have coupons 
and the values of those coupons so the designer can start.

Deanna: I’m waiting on Carter to get that information for us. I sent him an email this morning.

Peta: Oh great, what did he say?

Deanna: He wants to revamp the menu first and then he’ll send over the tablet content. He’ll be able to get started on it later next week. Is that okay?

Peta: Well, we need the menu and coupon values soon. I'd like to get the mock-ups uploaded by the end of next week. Can he hold off on the revamp and make 
this decision a priority? 

Deanna: Probably, but you’ll need to check with him. I know he was planning on his new menu being featured with the rollout. 

Peta: Does he change the menu often? How long does it usually take him?

Deanna: It all depends—sometimes he’s inspired and submits something new within a few days. Other times he likes to research what’s trending and test things out
for a few weeks. Why don’t you follow up with him about what you need. If he knows your timeline he’s usually pretty agreeable. But you never know with Carter! 
Let me know if you need me to step in.

Peta: Will do. Thank you!
