Hi Omar,

I wanted to formally introduce you to Peta Tsosie, our new project manager. She’s been doing an amazing job getting up to speed with all things Sauce & Spoon and
has already drafted the project charter for the tablet rollout, which I shared with you the other day. We’d both appreciate it if you could take a look at the
charter and let us know if you have any questions or concerns. We’re on track to start moving into the planning phase and get this project up and running!

Best,

Deanna

Thanks for the introduction, Deanna. 

Hello, Peta! Nice to officially meet you. I’ve heard great things about your work so far. Welcome to the Sauce & Spoon family! 

I reviewed the project charter and in general everything seems in line with our vision. There is one change I'd like to make before you finalize plans. I want to
expand the rollout to include all the dining areas—not just the bar area. We have ambitious revenue goals and I really want to make the most of this opportunity.
Please revise the charter to reflect this update and then I’ll sign off on it.

Thanks again,

Omar

Hi Omar,

Thank you for the kind words—so nice to meet you as well! I’ve really been enjoying this project so far and meeting everyone on the team. 

I understand why you want to expand the rollout and I'll definitely explore that possibility. Unfortunately, I can’t guarantee that we’ll be able to support an
expansion that big within our current budget or schedule. I'm also concerned about our ability to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction if we scale up
too quickly. I’ll conduct a comparison and see what’s feasible.

Great to meet you, and please do let me know if you have any other questions or requests.

Best,

Peta

Subject: Rollout expansion

Hi Peta,

I understand the need to consider the impact of the expansion, but let’s do everything we can to make this change. Omar doesn’t often get directly involved in
projects, so when he does it’s usually important!

Let me know how I can help.

Hi Deanna,

I’ll do what I can, but a change this big would require a major shift in our budget and timeline projections. It’s way out of scope for the time and resources 
we've allocated for the project. I’m also not 100% confident that we can support such a large rollout without significantly more training or hiring more staff.
I will do a thorough review, though, and get input from the rest of the team before we make a final decision.

Peta
