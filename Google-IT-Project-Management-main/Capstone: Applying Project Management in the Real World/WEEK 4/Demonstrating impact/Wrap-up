Wrap-up


So far you've used the skills you learned in previous videos to execute the entire life cycle of our example project with Sauce and Spoon. 

First, in the initiation phase, you learned how to create a project charter, and then you identified project goals and deliverables. You demonstrated how to conduct
a stakeholder analysis to prepare for negotiations with stakeholders.

Then you went into the planning phase where you determine tasks in order to accomplish the goals set forth. You learned the value of holding team brainstorms in
order to ensure all tasks were included and we explored some techniques for creating accurate time estimates for each of those tasks. As you moved from the planning 
to the execution phase, you started executing tasks as part of quality management, where you set quality standards and measured quality with user surveys. 

Next up was the closing phase where you learned how to connect problems to project goals by creating OKRs. You learned the importance of a closeout report.
