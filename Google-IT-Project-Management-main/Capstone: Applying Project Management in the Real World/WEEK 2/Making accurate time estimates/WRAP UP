Great job making it to the end of this section. In this last series of activities, you transitioned from the initiation phase of the project life cycle to the
planning phase, putting your knowledge and skills to work on a project plan, you analyzed project documentation to improve your domain knowledge and identify
project tasks, and you uncovered more tasks by conducting online research and analyzing key communications with the project team and task experts.

Then you determined accurate time estimates for each task by knowing which questions to ask and practicing effective negotiation techniques, you added confidence
level ratings to your estimates by using the three-point estimating method, and you learned how to demonstrate empathy in your conversations about task estimates. 

The project plan you've built for Sauce and Spoon will be an important part of your project management portfolio. It demonstrates your ability to break a large
project into a set of achievable, smaller tasks. You can also use your project plan during an interview to discuss how you approach project management work.

Up next, we'll get ready to move into the execution stage of the Sauce and Spoon tablet rollout project by creating a quality management plan.
