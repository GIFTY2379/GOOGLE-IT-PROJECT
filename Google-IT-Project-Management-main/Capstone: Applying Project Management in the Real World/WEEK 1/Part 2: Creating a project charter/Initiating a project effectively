Initiating a project effectively

The common problem that I see when you're in the initial phase of establishing a project is getting alignment between the key stakeholders. Also, securing the
right people to take on the project to incentivize your really talented project managers to want to join the project. 

I find that attraction is much more effective than promotion. I want talent to come towards the project versus just assigning the project work. That takes a lot 
of work. It's worth it because you're laying a good foundation for a successful project, and ultimately, the best velocity you could expect.

During the initiation phase, when I'm trying to refine the success criteria, I ask a lot of questions. There's probably a list of 20 of them. A couple examples
could be understanding the environment. What are some of the pitfalls or risks in the ecosystem? I will also try to do survey interviews, people in the environment, 
asking them, "What do you see as a problem?" Also, I ask a series of quantitative questions where applicable to understand what am I dealing with in terms of
measurables? "There are a lot of reasons why projects may fail.

In my opinion, it comes down to: one, really poor project definition: two, disorganization, the project lead is not establishing a framework to manage the project:
and three, there's too many people." Often, you have this effect where everyone will want to work on the project and then you don't have accountability.

Not every stakeholder is going to come at the problem with the same perspective. So I step back and understand, who are my key stakeholders? Let's just say for 
example there's two sponsors, the key stakeholders, and they're apples and oranges.

That's a problem. In that case, I'm going to have to meet with them a lot, understand broker compromise, and really work through that initial project
formation problem.
