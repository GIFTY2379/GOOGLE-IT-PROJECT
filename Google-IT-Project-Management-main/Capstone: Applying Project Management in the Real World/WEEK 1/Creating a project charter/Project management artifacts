Project management artifacts


In the introduction video to this course, you learned that you will record project details and create project documents as you observe Peta, Sauce & Spoon’s new 
project manager, planning and executing project deliverables for the pilot tablet rollout. By the end of this course, you’ll have developed a portfolio of project
management documents that will demonstrate your ability to manage stakeholders and teams, organize plans, and communicate project details. 



But what does this mean?

Throughout the activities in this course, you will be building and creating project management documents, commonly referred to as artifacts, to apply what you have
learned. Many of these artifacts may be applicable to projects in your current line of work or helpful in showcasing your skills when applying for a new project 
management role. 



We recommend saving these templates and completed artifacts in a digital folder or online storage drive for future reference. Organizing  your work in one place will
enable you to easily share your artifacts with future project managers, team members, and employers, as needed.
